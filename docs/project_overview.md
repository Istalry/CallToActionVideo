# Project Overview: Call to Action Video Generator

## Goal
The primary goal of this project is to empower streamers (Twitch, YouTube, etc.) to create professional, animated "Call to Action" (CTA) videos directly from their browser. These videos will prompt viewers to Subscribe, Follow, Like, etc.

## Key Features
1.  **Format Support**: Export videos in `.webm` format with transparency (alpha channel) for seamless integration into OBS/Streamlabs.
2.  **Orientation**: Support for both Horizontal (16:9) and Vertical (9:16) video formats.
3.  **Customization**:
    -   **Channel Image**: Users can upload their own avatar/logo.
    -   **Primary Text**: "Subscribe", "Follow", "Like", etc.
    -   **Secondary Text**: Channel URL or handle (e.g., twitch.tv/mychannel).
    -   **Animation**: "Catchy" animations (e.g., mouse cursor clicking, color changes, entrance/exit effects).
4.  **Privacy & Ease of Use**:
    -   No installation required (Web App).
    -   Client-side processing (Privacy-focused).

## Use Case Example
A generic "Subscribe" CTA:
1.  A rounded rectangle slides in.
2.  It displays the user's logo on the left.
3.  "SUBSCRIBE" text appears in bold on the right.
4.  A mouse cursor animates in, clicks the button.
5.  The button changes color and changed text to indicate "Subscribed".
6.  The element fades out/slides away.

## Success Metrics
-   Users can generate a video in under 2 minutes.
-   The generated WebM video plays correctly in OBS with a transparent background.
-   The UI feels premium and responsive.
